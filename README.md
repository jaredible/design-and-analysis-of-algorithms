# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

#### Description:
> This course addresses the design and analysis of fundamental algorithms in computer science. Topics include basic sorting algorithms, priority queues, order statistics, search trees, and hash tables. Analysis techniques may involve time and space complexity analysis of both iterative and recursive algorithms and analysis of algorithm correctness. 


#### Topics:
> The sequences of topics will be as follows (in that order):
> - Principles of algorithm analysis
> - Growth of functions
> - Basic recurrences
> - Elementary sorting methods
> - Priority queues and heapsort
> - Quicksort; mergesort
> - Radix sort
> - Elementary data structures
> - Hash tables
> - Binary search trees
> - Red-black trees
